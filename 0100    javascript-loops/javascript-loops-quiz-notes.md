ANSWER : where the loops is stopped and get out from it.
- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
ANSWER : Numer of loop hitting count - incremental.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
ANSWER : It is evaluated before executing the statement.
- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
ANSWER : It is evaluated before each iteration, and if its value converts to false, the loop is exited
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
ANSWER : It is checked each time before the loop runs.
         If it evaluates to true, the statement or code in the loop is executed.
         If it evaluates to false, the loop stops.
         If it is omitted, it automatically evaluates to true.
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
ANSWER : It is evaluated after execution.
- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
ANSWER : break.
- What does the `++` increment operator do?
ANSWER : incremental by 1.
